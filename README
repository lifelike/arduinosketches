My Arduino sketch directory, or most of it anyway. My sketches are GPL v3
unless otherwise stated in a source file.

DogLcd library
 Eberhard Fahle <e.fahle@wayoda.org> 2010
 GPL v3

MIDI library
 Francois Best, Forty Seven Effects 2011
 GPL

TM1638 library
 Ricardo Batista
 GPL v3

 Also see individual library directories for source code and more info.
 There are probably newer versions available elsewhere anyway. I just
 keep copies in here to make sure I have something that my own sketches
 compiles with.
